    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    We chose to work with open city data about Melbourne, Australia. The reason why we chose this city was based mainly on a personal
    interest. Some of the team members will spend a semester at this city as exchange students. We thought this is a good
    opportunity to learn something about the city before moving there. We selected 4 dataset from the australian government's
    website, two about parking spots location and availability and two about pedestrian traffic. The main dataset don't include
    location attributes, they are using sensor id's only, so we looked for additional dataset where the exact locations are
    provided. The link to the four dataset can be found on the main page. Our goal was to provide an easily understandable
    visualization about the traffic of Melbourne. We though that giving a simple showcase about an average day would be nice
    as an introduction. Than we wanted to give an overview to the end user about our data, and offer the possibility for
    the user to dig deeper in the outstanding patterns.

    <h2>Basic Statistics</h2>
    Our Datasets:
    <ul>
      <li>Pedestrian sensor locations, 52 rows, 10 columns (each row represents a sensor)</li>
      <li>Pedestrian volume, 2M rows, 10 columns (each row represents a measurement by a sensor)</li>
      <li>Parking sensor location, 3271 row, 6 columns (each row represents a sensor)</li>
      <li>Parking sensor data, 34M rows, 13 columns (each row represents a measurement by a sensor)</li>
    </ul>

    After downloading the 4 required dataset we performed a comprehensive pre-processing. For this we wanted to use python's
    famous library for time series data called pandas. Our goal was to merge the separate dataset for each category into
    smaller one, which will be suitable for the visualization. Quite early it turned out that pandas is not the best tool
    for us, because some of our dataset contains over 30 million rows. The dataset for the pedestrian sensors and measurements,
    and the files with the parking data were imported into two SQLite database, one for every pedestrian data and one for
    every parking data. From now on we worked with these data separately. The questions emerged during the explanatory data
    analysis and design were the followings:

    <ul>
      <li>what attribute to keep</li>
      <li>how many and what type of CSVs are necessary</li>
      <li>what resolution we need in order to have a meaningful visualization</li>
    </ul>

    Using SQLite database allowed us to write the python code in a memory efficient way. We created 5 CSV files in total,
    two for the introduction visualization, because we needed the data in an hourly resolution; one for the yearly overview
    where the two category got merged into one CSV and we deleted the location information here because it was not necessary
    for this plot; and finally two for the detailed views where the user can explore different periods of the year. We decided
    to have multiple smaller CSV files instead of having one big in order to achieve a faster loading time, continuous visualization
    and to get rid of the unwanted lags. These files also contain only the information which was necessary during the preprocessing
    and the information which was using in the visualizations.

    <h2>Genre</h2>

    Due to the fact that we offer several ways for the user to interact with the visualization through starting animations, and
    time-manipulations, while still having a definite ordering of screens, we would say that our story is a hybrid between
    user and author driven. We always provide introductions to the data sets, and tooltips on hovering as well as several
    ways to interact. Tooltips are only provided for the pedestrian dataset, there was no meaningful location name for the
    parking sensors. Assessing all of these together our genre is thought to be a mixture of Magazine style with annotated
    chart elements.
    <br> We used timeline sliders to structure the sub-visualizations. The user can move the little square located on the right
    side of the maps to select a custom date and observe the datapoints. Throughout the main page we are using the same colors
    in the charts. The ordering of the page, as we mentioned before, is a linear ordering, the user starts with an introduction,
    than can observe an overview and finally check details on demand about different periods of the year. To communicate
    the whole message we are providing textual information as well in the form of introductory texts and summaries.

    <h2>Visualization</h2>

    We think that this story cannot be told without maps and timelines, so our primary objective has always been to have a map
    where interesting patterns can be observed along the time. This is why we looked for additional datasets, to be able
    to pair each sensor measurement to a location. Plotting the sensor location on the map, and coloring them based on the
    traffic measured by that sensor is the best way to visualize traffic through the time. The timeline's main purpose is
    to provide an overview, to showcase patterns over the year. Some of them are quite obvious, but some of them needs further
    explanation, which can be accessed by clicking on the timeline.

    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    During the data preprocessing we spent a lot of time with our biggest dataset, the information about the parking sensors.
    We tried several approaches, most of them failed because of heave memory usage. However spending extra time on preprocessing,
    and splitting the data into several CSS files resulted in a fast visualization. We haven't calculated with the population
    density during this project, because the sensors are located in the Central Business District of Melbourne, where mostly
    offices and shopping centers can be found. As a further improvement the parking spots could be grouped together based
    on proximity, to have a less crowded map. The reason we are missing tooltips on these maps about parking data is because
    we are missing some meaningful location. It would be nice to have something similar to the ones we have for the pedestrian
    datasets.
