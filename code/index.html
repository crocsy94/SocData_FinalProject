    <div class="title">When does <span class="emphasize">Melbourne</span> go to work?</div>
    <p>
      We investigated data from parking sensors and pedestrian counters on the streets to figure out when does the city
      wake up and go to work. To see our results, play around with the visualizations below.
    </p>
    <div class="title">An average day...</div>
    <iframe id="hourly-visualization" src="hourly_visualization.html" frameborder="0" class="hourly-maps"></iframe>

    <div class="title">Is it different on holidays?</div>
    <p>
      To figure out, instead of the parking places, we analysed the frequency of people leaving parking
      places. This correlates well with the pedestrian data since both of them are indications of people
      moving. Here is what we discovered by taking a look at year 2016.

    <div id="period-title" class="title">During a regular, uneventful period...</div>
    <p id="period-description">
      In the currently selected period, no major event is taking place. Therefore the following visualizations show
      the average behaviour of Melbourne’s population.
    </p>
    <iframe id="daily-visualization" src="daily_visualization.html" frameborder="0"
            class="daily_visualization"></iframe>

    <div class="title">Conclusion</div>
    <p>
      The pedestrian dataset correlates well with the average daily number of parking place users. We can
      clearly identify major events just by looking at the dataset.
