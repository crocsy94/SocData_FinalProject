    <div class="title">When does <span class="emphasize">Melbourne</span> go to work?</div>
    <p>
      We investigated data from parking sensors and pedestrian counters on the streets to figure out when does the city
      wake up and go to work. To see our results, play around with the visualizations below.
    </p>
    <div class="title">An average day...</div>

    <div class="title">Is it different on holidays?</div>
    <p>
      To figure out this question, we widened our scope for the year of 2016.
      The parking dataset contains information about which parking bay was occupied in what time period.
      We analysed the frequency of people leaving parking places for each day. The chart below displays
      the average number of parking bay usage for each day as well as the average number of citizens counted
      by a sensor in downtown. The two dataset correlates well with each other, the numbers are quite low
      during the weekends for both the parking and pedestrian data. It should be noted that the sensors are
      mainly located in the Central Business District of Melbourne, where the number of households are barely
      mentionable and only offices and shopping centers can be found. Some odd patterns can be noticed at
      the beginning of the year, somewhere around April and at the end of the year. Click on the chart to
      gain further insight about these periods.

      In the currently selected period, no major event is taking place. Therefore the following visualizations show
      the average behaviour of Melbourne’s population.

    <div class="title">Conclusion</div>
    <p>
      The pedestrian dataset correlates well with the average daily number of parking place users. We can
      clearly identify major events just by looking at the yearly graph.
